_rose5.png,270.0,0.5,514,161,720,480,"A delicate pink rose, partially unfurled, sways gently in the breeze. Its petals, soft and velvety, catch the light, creating subtle shifts in color from deep pink to a lighter hue. Surrounding the main bloom, smaller buds remain tightly closed, hinting at the promise of future blossoms. The dark green leaves provide a rich contrast, their surfaces glistening slightly as they move in harmony with the rose. The scene is serene, with the gentle motion of the rose adding a sense of life and tranquility to the moment."
